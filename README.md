Practice of Normal Distribution - Test and Transformation.

many models expect features to be normally distributed. 
Here we can check normality
`1)stats.normaltest - which returns chisquare and p-value.
graphical plots
1)distplot
2)qq-plot`

if not normal- how to transform
`1)using scipy and stat library
2)using sklearn - Function and Power Transformer.`
